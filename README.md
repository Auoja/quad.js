# quad.js

A JavaScript Quadtree implementation.

## Usage
Coming soon...

## Demo
There is a demo available in `demo/index.html` where some random points are their bounding boxes are rendered. It is possible to add points by clicking. It is also possible to retrieve points (not happy with how this works btw) by dragging.

## Testing
Make sure you have [Node](http://nodejs.org) installed and then install [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) either globally:

```
	node install -g mocha
```

... or locally:

```
	node install
```

Then just run:

```
	node test
```
or:

```
	node test/test.js
```
